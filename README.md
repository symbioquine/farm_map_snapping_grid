## Deprecation

This snapping grid functionality has now been [contributed](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-map/issues/79) back to farmOS-map. It was released in [farmOS-map version 1.3.0](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-map/releases/tag/v1.3.0) and will likely be included in the 7.x-1.5 release of farmOS.

## Installation

The module `.tar.gz` is uploaded on the [releases page](https://github.com/symbioquine/farm_map_snapping_grid/releases) of this repository.

## Building From Source
